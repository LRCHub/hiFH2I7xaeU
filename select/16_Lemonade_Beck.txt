Kiss the girl slay a hag
Feel the flavor freedom fag
Get up early, do your chores
Chase the murder with the rancid pores
The thyroids with friendly blade
The haunted beast with faces flayed
Silver chicken make a fuss
Reveling in molten puss
Favorite patrons crack their death
With arteries and tinsel breath
Revolution purple fist
Pummeling your angel piss
Sour powered wussy soul
Solid darkness goddess show
Weaving heirlooms thru the hour
From the cradle monster cowered

Waking up delicious ghost
They'll eat themselves from coast to coast
Dancing in their bandages
The victims grow leaving messages

Hear the commune cocaine blast
Earthly mothers with flattened chests
Sloping gardens, mystic hours
Fried vibrations overpowered
In the mangles of their hair
Shrouded spirits and underwear
Crazy wires fuse their brains
Drinking water sugar cane
Playing drums and broken flutes
Homeless gods and iron boots
Flying wicked love control
Circus storm and demon skull
Entering the solar sphere
Planets meld crystal clear
Thrashing in the astral glow
Flashing in their fleshly show

Waking up delicious ghost
They'll eat themselves from coast to coast
Dancing in their bandages
The victims grow leaving messages
