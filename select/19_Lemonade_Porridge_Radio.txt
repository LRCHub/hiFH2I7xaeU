And it takes more than lemonade
To make sense of make sense of the day
And it takes more than lemonade
To make sense of make sense of the day

And it takes more than one mistake
To figure out what you can break
And it takes more than lemonade
To make sense of make sense of the day

And it takes more than weed to make sense of the day and
It takes more than one of your stupid mistakes and
It takes more than this to make sense to make sense of the day
And it takes more than weed to make sense of the day and
It takes more than weed to make sense of the day and
It takes more than one of your stupid mistakes and
It takes more than lemonade

It takes more than lemonade
To make sense of make sense of the day
It takes more than lemonade
To make sense of make sense of the day
