Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Suck your lemonade
In the sun

When it's hot and tropical
You drip just like glue
That sunlight's burning into you
You're dripping all over

When it's hot and tropical
You drip just like glue
With that sunlight's burning into you
You're dripping all over

Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off your tongue
Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off of your pink tongue

I see you melting up to the stuff on your stereo
With your friends in the heat, in your Alfa Romeo
You're dripping all over

Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off your tongue
Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off of your pink tongue

(Suck your lemonade)
(In the sun)
(Suck your lemonade)
Off of your pink tongue
(Suck your lemonade)
(In the sun)
Watch it run
Off of your pink tongue

Creeping to the shade
Suck your lemonade
Creeping to the shade
Suck your lemonade

You just
Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off your tongue
Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off of your pink tongue

Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off your tongue
Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off of your pink tongue

Off of your pink tongue (Suck your lemonade)
(In the sun)
With your friends in the heat, in your Alfa Romeo
